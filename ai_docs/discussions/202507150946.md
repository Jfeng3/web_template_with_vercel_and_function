# Development Session: Hashtag Features Implementation

## Date: July 15, 2025, 09:46 AM

## Overview
This session focused on implementing two major hashtag-related features for the Daily Notes Writer application:

1. **Hashtag Tag Selection** - Enable users to select tags by typing "#" in the note editor
2. **Weekly Tag Creation** - Allow users to create up to 2 new tags per week starting Monday

## Feature 1: Hashtag Tag Selection

### Implementation
- Created `HashtagTextarea` component with real-time hashtag detection
- Displays dropdown with available weekly tags when user types "#"
- Supports tag filtering and insertion at cursor position
- Integrated seamlessly into existing note editor

### Key Components
- **File**: `src/components/HashtagTextarea.tsx`
- **Changes**: Replaced standard textarea in `src/pages/Index.tsx`
- **Result**: Users can now type "#" to quickly select and insert tags

## Feature 2: Weekly Tag Creation

### Implementation
- Extended `HashtagTextarea` to support creating new tags
- Added tag slot tracking system in Zustand store
- Implemented weekly reset mechanism (Monday refresh)
- Limited to 2 tags per week as specified

### Key Updates
- **Store Methods**: Added `canCreateNewTag()` and `createNewTag()` to `notesStore.ts`
- **Week Detection**: Automatically detects new week and refreshes tag slots
- **UI Enhancement**: Shows "Create" option with Plus icon for new tags

### Technical Details
```typescript
// Weekly tag creation logic
- Check if current week > stored week → Allow 2 new tags
- Within same week → Check available slots (max 2)
- Tag creation replaces empty slots first, then overwrites existing
```

## Architecture Decisions
1. **Minimal Changes**: Preserved existing tag system while adding new functionality
2. **State Management**: Used existing Zustand store for consistency
3. **Database**: Leveraged existing `weeklyTags` table without schema changes
4. **User Experience**: Maintained simple, intuitive interface

## Testing Results
- Build successful with no TypeScript errors
- Development server running on port 8080
- All features working as specified

## Commits
1. `feat: Add hashtag tag selection in note editor` - First feature implementation
2. `feat: Add weekly tag creation system` - Second feature implementation

Both features were successfully merged into the main branch and are ready for production use.
