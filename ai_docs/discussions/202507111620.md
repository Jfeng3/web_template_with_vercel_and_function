# AI Assistant Feature Implementation Discussion

## Date: 2025-07-11 16:20

## Overview
Implemented an AI-powered critic and rephrase feature for the Daily Notes Writer application, allowing users to get instant feedback and alternative phrasings for their notes.

## What We Did

### 1. Created Feature Documentation
- Added `ai_assistant_critic_and_rephrase.md` in the features folder
- Defined the purpose and functionality of both critic and rephrase features
- Specified UI components and user experience flow

### 2. Built UI Components

#### AIAssistantButtons Component
- Created two prominent buttons: "Critic" and "Rephrase"
- Added icons: MessageCircle for critic, RefreshCw for rephrase
- Implemented loading states with spinner animations
- Buttons disabled when textarea is empty
- Clean design following project's minimalist guidelines

#### AIResponseModal Component
- Built a modal to display AI responses
- Critic mode shows:
  - Quality score (60-100)
  - Detailed feedback
  - Key suggestions with bullet points
- Rephrase mode shows:
  - Improved version with word count
  - Alternative approaches
  - Apply buttons to use suggestions
- Loading states and proper error handling

### 3. Integrated OpenAI API

#### OpenAI Service (`src/api/openai.ts`)
- Installed OpenAI SDK package
- Created two main functions:
  - `getCriticFeedback()`: Analyzes content for quality, clarity, and engagement
  - `getRephraseOptions()`: Generates improved versions and alternatives
- Uses GPT-5 model for best writing quality
- Proper error handling and response parsing

#### API Integration in Index Component
- Added state management for AI interactions
- Replaced placeholder handlers with real API calls
- Connected loading states and error handling
- Implemented apply functionality for rephrase options

### 4. Environment Setup
- Added `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY` to .env file
- Configured OpenAI client with API key
- Set up for browser-based API calls

## Technical Decisions

### Model Selection
- Started with GPT-5 for cost efficiency
- Upgraded to GPT-5 for better writing quality
- Finally settled on GPT-5 per user request for optimal performance

### UI/UX Design
- Positioned AI buttons near the word count for easy access
- Modal design for displaying responses without disrupting workflow
- One-click apply functionality for rephrase suggestions
- Maintained consistent design with existing app aesthetics

### Architecture
- Client-side API calls using `dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true`
- Modular component structure for easy maintenance
- Proper separation of concerns between UI and API logic
