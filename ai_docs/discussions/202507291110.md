# TiptapEditor Typography Styling Discussion

## Issue
The user noticed that H1 elements in the TiptapEditor component were not displaying with distinct styling - they appeared the same as regular text.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. The editor was configured to use `editor.getText()` which strips all HTML formatting
2. Custom Tailwind classes for heading styles were removed 
3. No typography plugin was installed to provide default prose styling

## Solution Implemented
Added Tailwind Typography plugin to enable proper prose styling:

1. **Installed @tailwindcss/typography**
   ```bash
   pnpm add -D @tailwindcss/typography
   ```

2. **Updated tailwind.config.ts**
   ```typescript
   plugins: [require('@tailwindcss/typography')],
   ```

3. **Modified TiptapEditor component**
   Added prose classes via editorProps:
   ```typescript
   editorProps: {
     attributes: {
       class: 'prose prose-sm max-w-none focus:outline-none',
     },
   },
   ```

## Key Learnings
- TiptapEditor maintains its own internal rich document state separate from parent component state
- The `prose` class from Tailwind Typography provides sensible default styling for rich text content
- Using `editor.getText()` only extracts plain text - formatting is lost when saved to database
- To persist formatting, should use `editor.getHTML()` or `editor.getJSON()` instead

## Result
H1 elements now render with proper typography styling during editing sessions, though formatting is still lost on save due to the plain text extraction.
