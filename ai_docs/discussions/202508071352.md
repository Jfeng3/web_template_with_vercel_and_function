# Technical Updates - August 7, 2025

## Overview
Updated the Daily Notes Writer application to use GPT-5 model and improved OpenAI API integration with proper parameter handling and debugging capabilities.

## Changes Made

### 1. Model Upgrade
- Updated from GPT-4.1 to GPT-5 across all OpenAI API calls
- Applied to both critic feedback and rephrase functionality
- Updated documentation to reflect the model change

### 2. OpenAI API Parameter Updates
- **Removed deprecated parameter**: Changed `max_tokens` to `max_completion_tokens` for GPT-5 compatibility
- **Temperature adjustment**: Increased temperature from 0.7/0.8 to 1.0 for more creative and varied responses
- **Added debugging**: Implemented console logging for API responses to aid in development

### 3. Enhanced Rephrase Functionality
- Improved the rephrase prompt with detailed editing policy
- Added support for minimal, idiomatic changes while preserving author's voice
- Included Chinese-to-English translation capability
- Implemented phrase bank feature for granular text improvements

### 4. UI Improvements
- Fixed theme imports in Sonner component by removing unused next-themes dependency
- Updated Tailwind configuration to use CSS variables for better theme consistency
- Ensured proper color mapping for system-wide theme support

### 5. Code Quality
- Added proper error handling for API calls
- Implemented response cleaning to remove unwanted prefacing text
- Added the `deleteNote` function import to Index component for future functionality

## Technical Details

### API Changes
```typescript
// Before
max_tokens: 500,
temperature: 0.7

// After
max_completion_tokens: 500,
temperature: 1
```

### New Features
- Console logging for debugging: `console.log('[OpenAI][CriticFeedback] Raw response:', response);`
- Phrase bank suggestions with JSON parsing and fallback heuristics
- Support for idiomatic phrase replacements

## Build Status
- Build completed successfully with no errors
- Only warning about chunk size (>500KB) which is acceptable for now
- All changes tested and deployed to production

## Commits
- `f0e87b5`: Fixed AI model references and theme imports
- `9fbbb95`: Updated OpenAI API parameters and added logging

## Next Steps
- Monitor the GPT-5 performance and adjust temperature if needed
- Consider implementing code splitting to reduce chunk size
- Utilize the phrase bank feature in the UI for more granular editing options
