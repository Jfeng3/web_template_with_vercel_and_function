# Development Setup and Sales Narrative Creation

## Date: 2025-08-19 11:47

## Summary
Fixed Vercel proxy errors and created a sales narrative for Daily Notes Writer. Set up proper development scripts to run frontend and backend separately or together.

## Issue: Vite Proxy Error
The application was throwing `[vite] http proxy error: /api/rephrase` because:
- Vite was configured to proxy `/api` requests to `localhost:3000`
- No backend server was running on port 3000
- The API routes are Vercel Functions that need Vercel CLI to run locally

## Solution: Development Scripts
Added development scripts to package.json:
```json
"dev": "concurrently \"pnpm:dev:frontend\" \"pnpm:dev:backend\"",
"dev:frontend": "vite",
"dev:backend": "vercel dev --listen 3000 --yes",
"dev:all": "vercel dev --listen 3000 --yes"
```

### How it works:
- **Frontend (Vite)**: Runs on port 8080 (as configured in vite.config.ts)
- **Backend (Vercel Functions)**: Runs on port 3000
- **Proxy**: Vite proxies `/api/*` requests from 8080 to 3000

### Development options:
1. `pnpm dev` - Runs both frontend and backend concurrently
2. `pnpm dev:frontend` - Frontend only
3. `pnpm dev:backend` - Backend with Vercel
4. `pnpm dev:all` - Everything through Vercel on single port

## Sales Narrative
Created `docs/sales_narrative.md` highlighting:
- Problem: Content creators struggle with capturing and refining thoughts
- Solution: Focused writing companion with two-stage workflow
- Key benefits:
  - Voice-to-text capture
  - AI-powered refinement
  - Simple organization with weekly tags
  - 300-word limit for focused content

## Technical Changes
1. Installed `concurrently` for parallel script execution
2. Installed `vercel` CLI as dev dependency
3. Simplified `vercel.json` to only include functions configuration
4. Fixed esbuild error by clearing `.vercel` cache

## Production Deployment
In production on Vercel:
- Frontend: Served as static files from CDN
- Backend: `/api` functions deployed as serverless functions
- No proxy needed - everything runs on same domain
- Example: `yourapp.vercel.app` → frontend, `yourapp.vercel.app/api/*` → functions
