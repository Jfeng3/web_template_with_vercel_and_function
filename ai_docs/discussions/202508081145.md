# Real-time Transcription Implementation - August 8, 2025

## Overview
Implemented real-time speech-to-text transcription functionality in the Daily Notes Writer application, enabling users to dictate notes naturally with live text insertion.

## Implementation Approach

### Technology Choice
- **Selected**: Browser's native Web Speech API (SpeechRecognition)
- **Considered**: OpenAI Realtime API via WebSocket
- **Reason**: Web Speech API provides immediate functionality without complex authentication or server setup

### Architecture
1. **Custom React Hook** (`useRealtimeTranscription.ts`)
   - Encapsulates speech recognition logic
   - Manages recording state and error handling
   - Provides clean API for components

2. **Component Integration**
   - Updated TextEditor and ComparisonTextEditor
   - Added microphone button with visual states
   - Implemented real-time text insertion

## Key Features Implemented

### User Experience
- **One-click recording**: Microphone button toggles recording state
- **Visual feedback**: Red border, pulsing recording indicator, status messages
- **Real-time transcription**: Text appears as user speaks, not after completion
- **Interim results**: Preview text shown while speaking, finalized on pause

### Technical Features
- **Continuous recognition**: Supports long dictation sessions
- **Error handling**: Permission requests, browser compatibility checks
- **State management**: Proper cleanup and memory management
- **Accessibility**: Clear visual and text indicators for recording state

## Code Structure

### Hook Pattern
```typescript
// Input: Callback functions for transcript and error handling
// Processing: useEffect sets up speech recognition with event handlers
// Output: State variables (isRecording, error, etc.) and control functions (start, stop)
// Result: Components re-render when state changes, updating UI
```

### Component Integration
- **TextEditor**: Full real-time transcription with visual indicators
- **ComparisonTextEditor**: Same functionality for comparison mode
- **Visual indicators**: Recording borders, pulsing dots, interim transcript display

## Technical Decisions

### Speech Recognition API
- Used browser's native SpeechRecognition over server-based solutions
- Enabled `continuous: true` and `interimResults: true` for real-time experience
- Implemented proper error handling for permission and compatibility issues

### State Management
- Separated interim transcript (preview) from final transcript (committed)
- Used refs to track base content for proper text insertion
- Handled spacing and formatting automatically

### User Interface
- Added red visual indicators during recording
- Animated microphone button (mic â†’ red pulsing square)
- Inline status messages with interim transcript preview
- Smooth transitions and accessibility considerations

## Benefits Achieved
1. **Natural dictation**: Users can speak naturally instead of typing
2. **Real-time feedback**: Immediate visual confirmation of speech recognition
3. **Seamless integration**: Works within existing note-taking workflow
4. **No external dependencies**: Uses browser APIs, no additional costs
5. **Accessibility**: Supports users who prefer voice input over typing

## Next Steps
- Monitor user feedback for accuracy and usability
- Consider adding language selection options
- Potential integration with OpenAI Realtime API for enhanced accuracy
- Voice command support for editing operations
