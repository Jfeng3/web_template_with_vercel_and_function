# Discussion: Fix Invalid Time Value Error - 202507111112

## Overview
Fixed a critical bug where the application was throwing "Invalid time value" errors when attempting to display note timestamps.

## Problem
The Note interface in `src/types/notes.ts` was missing the `updatedAt` field, which was being returned by the database but not properly typed in the TypeScript interface. This caused runtime errors when the application tried to parse and display the update timestamps.

## Solution
Added the missing `updatedAt` field to the Note interface:

```typescript
export interface Note {
  id: string;
  content: string;
  tags: string[];
  week: number;
  year: number;
  status: 'draft' | 'ready' | 'posted';
  wordCount: number;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;  // Added this field
}
```

## Impact
- Resolved the "Invalid time value" errors
- Ensured proper type safety for all Note objects
- Maintained consistency between database schema and TypeScript types

## Files Modified
- `src/types/notes.ts` - Added `updatedAt` field to Note interface

## Commit
The fix was committed with message: "fix: Add updatedAt field to Note interface and fix Invalid time value error"
