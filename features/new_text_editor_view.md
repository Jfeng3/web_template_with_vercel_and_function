A minimal, clean text editor interface designed for content creation with essential formatting tools and AI-powered assistance features.

## Visual Design

- **Large input area** with placeholder text "What's in your mind?"
- **Green rounded border** giving it a fresh, modern look
- **Clean white background** for focused writing experience
- **Responsive layout** that adapts to content

## Toolbar Components

The toolbar is positioned at the bottom of the editor with the following tools:

### Formatting Tools (Left Side)

1. **Image (📷)** - Insert images into the content
2. **Text Format (Aa)** - Basic text formatting options (bold, italic, etc.)


### AI-Powered Tools (Center)
3. **Rephrase (🔄)** - AI-powered content rephrasing
   - Icon: Circular arrows or refresh symbol
   - Function: Rewrite selected text for clarity or tone
   
4. **Critic (💭)** - AI content review and suggestions

## User Experience

- **Minimalist approach** - Only essential tools visible
- **Icon-based interface** - Quick recognition and access
- **Subtle interactions** - Hover states and gentle animations
- **Focus on content** - Large writing space with tools that don't distract

## Technical Considerations

- Toolbar should be sticky/fixed at bottom
- Tools should have tooltips on hover
- AI features should show loading states during processing
- Support for keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Mobile-responsive design with appropriate touch targets
