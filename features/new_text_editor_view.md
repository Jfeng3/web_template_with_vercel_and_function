4. **Unordered List (â€¢)** - Create bulleted lists

6. **Mention (@)** - Add mentions or references

### AI-Powered Tools (Center)

## User Experience

- **Minimalist approach** - Only essential tools visible
- **Icon-based interface** - Quick recognition and access
- **Subtle interactions** - Hover states and gentle animations
- **Focus on content** - Large writing space with tools that don't distract

## Technical Considerations

- Toolbar should be sticky/fixed at bottom
- Tools should have tooltips on hover
- AI features should show loading states during processing
- Support for keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Mobile-responsive design with appropriate touch targets
